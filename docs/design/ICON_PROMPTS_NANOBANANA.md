## 사용 가이드

### 방법 1: 개별 생성
각 아이콘 프롬프트를 나노바나나에 하나씩 입력합니다. `[공통]` 부분을 실제 텍스트로 대체하여 붙여넣기합니다.

### 방법 2: 시트 생성 (권장)
그룹별로 아이콘 시트를 한 번에 생성합니다. 아래 프롬프트를 그룹 앞에 추가합니다:

```
Generate an icon sheet with [N] icons arranged in a single row on a white background.
Each icon is 24x24px with 12px spacing between them.
All icons share the same duotone style: primary shapes at full opacity, secondary details at 40% opacity.
Monochrome black, flat vector, no gradients, no shadows, rounded 2px corners.

Icons from left to right:
1. [아이콘 설명 1]
2. [아이콘 설명 2]
...
```

### 방법 3: 스타일 레퍼런스 고정
첫 번째 아이콘(restaurant)을 먼저 생성하여 스타일을 확정한 뒤, 나머지 아이콘에 해당 이미지를 스타일 레퍼런스로 사용합니다:

```
Using the attached image as style reference, create a duotone icon for [아이콘 설명].
Match the exact same visual weight, corner radius, opacity levels, and grid alignment.
24x24px, monochrome black, flat vector.
```

## 생성 후 후처리 단계

1. **AI 생성물 → 비트맵 (PNG)** 나노바나나 출력
2. **비트맵 → SVG 변환** vectorizer.io 또는 Adobe Illustrator Image Trace
3. **SVG 정리** 불필요한 패스 단순화, viewBox 통일
4. **레이어 분리** `duotone-primary` / `duotone-secondary` 그룹으로 수동 분리
5. **SVGO 최적화** `npx svgo --config svgo.config.js input.svg -o output.svg`
6. **검증** 12px / 16px / 24px / 32px 에서 식별성 확인

### SVGO 권장 설정

```js
// svgo.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'removeDoctype',
    'removeXMLProcInst',
    'removeComments',
    'removeMetadata',
    'removeEditorsNSData',
    'cleanupAttrs',
    'mergeStyles',
    'inlineStyles',
    'minifyStyles',
    'removeUselessDefs',
    'cleanupNumericValues',
    'convertColors',
    'removeUnknownsAndDefaults',
    'removeNonInheritableGroupAttrs',
    'removeUselessStrokeAndFill',
    'cleanupEnableBackground',
    'removeHiddenElems',
    'removeEmptyText',
    'convertShapeToPath',
    'convertEllipseToCircle',
    'moveGroupAttrsToElems',
    'collapseGroups',
    'convertPathData',
    'convertTransform',
    'removeEmptyAttrs',
    'removeEmptyContainers',
    'removeUnusedNS',
    'sortDefsChildren',
    'removeTitle',
    'removeDesc',
    {
      name: 'removeAttrs',
      params: { attrs: ['data-name', 'class'] }
    }
  ]
}
```

> **주의**: SVGO 최적화 시 `duotone-primary` / `duotone-secondary` 클래스가 제거되지 않도록 `removeAttrs` 플러그인에서 `class`를 제거 대상에서 제외하거나, 최적화 후 수동으로 클래스를 다시 추가해야 합니다.
