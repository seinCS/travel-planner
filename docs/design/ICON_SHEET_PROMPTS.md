## 생성 순서 및 팁

### 권장 순서

1. **시트 1 (카테고리)** 을 먼저 생성하여 스타일 기준을 잡습니다
2. 결과가 마음에 들면 나머지 시트에 동일 스타일로 진행합니다
3. 마음에 안 들면 시트 1의 프롬프트를 조정하여 재생성합니다

### 스타일 일관성 유지 팁

시트 1 결과가 확정되면, 시트 2~7 생성 시 아래 문장을 프롬프트 맨 앞에 추가합니다:

```
Using the exact same icon style as the attached reference image.
Match the stroke weight, corner radius, opacity levels, shape language, and visual weight precisely.
```

그리고 시트 1 이미지를 레퍼런스로 첨부합니다.

### 결과물이 24px보다 크게 나올 경우

나노바나나는 고해상도로 출력하므로 실제 픽셀 크기는 훨씬 클 수 있습니다. 이 경우:
- 비율만 맞으면 OK (정사각형 1:1 비율로 각 아이콘이 동일 크기)
- SVG 변환 시 `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`로 정규화하면 됩니다

### 아이콘 분리 (시트 → 개별 파일)

생성된 시트 이미지에서 개별 아이콘을 잘라내는 방법:
1. **Figma**: 시트 이미지 임포트 → 각 아이콘 영역 슬라이스 → SVG 내보내기
2. **ImageMagick**: `convert sheet.png -crop 24x24 +repage icon_%d.png`
3. **수동**: 이미지 편집기에서 각 아이콘 영역 선택 → 개별 저장
